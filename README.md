# Housing Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project focuses on predicting house sale prices using machine learning techniques. Housing datasets typically contain a mix of numerical and categorical features that describe various characteristics of a property, such as area, number of rooms, quality rating, location, and more. By learning patterns from this data, machine learning models can forecast the value of a house with considerable accuracy.

## 📘 Introduction

House price prediction is a regression task where the goal is to estimate a continuous numerical value (Sale Price). Machine Learning helps identify complex relationships between house attributes and their market value, allowing both buyers and sellers to make informed decisions.

This project uses **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), encoding techniques, scaling, and regression algorithms** to build a robust predictive system.

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand dataset features

- Analyze relationships between variables

- Handle missing values

- Convert categorical information into numerical format

- Normalize numerical values

- Train multiple machine learning algorithms

- Compare their performance

- Identify the best model for price prediction
